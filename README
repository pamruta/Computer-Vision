This directory provides scripts for computer vision algorithms.

[1] face-detect-video.py: Real-Time Face Detection implemented in Python using OpenCV library.

	Usage: python face-detect-video.py [VIDEO-FILE]
	e.g. python face-detect-video.py samples/face.mp4

	If no video-file is given, it will capture video from your computer's webcam.

[2] person-detect-video.py: Real-Time Person Detection implemented in Python using OpenCV library.

	Usage: python person-detect-video.py [VIDEO-FILE]
        e.g. python person-detect-video.py samples/person.mp4

        If no video-file is given, it will capture video from your computer's webcam.

[3] barcode.py: Barcode Scanner implemented in Python using Zbar library.

	Scans and prints the barcode in the given input image-file, along with the product-name
	if the product is listed in the UPC Database.

	Usage: python barcode.py [IMAGE-FILE]
	e.g. python barcode.py samples/barcode.png

	If the product is not found in the UPC Database, only the barcode is printed.

[4] ocr.py: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images using
	Google's Cloud Vision API

	Usage: python ocr.py [IMAGE-FILE]
	e.g. python ocr.py samples/ocr.jpeg

Directory /samples contains sample image and video files for testing.
