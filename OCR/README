This directory contains implementation of OCR or Optical Character Recognition
using Google Vision, AWS Rekognition and Tesseract libraries.

[1] ocr-service.py:	REST API built in Python Flask.
			After running "python ocr-service.py", visit: 127.0.0.1:5000/ocr
			in your browser. The API takes following parameters:

			[1] choice: [aws, google-vision, tesseract]
			    If no choice is selected, google-vision is used by default.

			[2] file: INPUT FILE-NAME to run OCR.
			    The input file should be placed in /static directory.

			[3] json: REGEX FILE to extract key-value pairs.
			    If this option is not selected, output of OCR is plain-text by default.
			    Sample regex files are provided in /regex directory.

			e.g. 127.0.0.1:5000/ocr?choice=google-vision&file=1.jpg

			The above API call will run google-vision OCR on file static/1.jpg and
			creates output in plain-text format.

			"127.0.0.1:5000/ocr?file=1.jpg&json=NY-DL.json"

			This API call will produce output in JSON format by extracting key-value pairs
			as defined in the given regex file at /regex/NY-DL.json

[2] aws-ocr.py:		Python program to run OCR from AWS Rekognition library.
			Please install AWS SDK boto3 and set your AWS credentials to run this script.

			Usage: python aws-ocr.py INPUT-FILE

[3] google-ocr.py:	Python script to run OCR from Google Vision library.
			Please install google-cloud Python SDK and set google-cloud credentials to run this script.

			Usage: python google-ocr.py INPUT-FILE

[4] tesseract-ocr.py:	Python script to run OCR using Tesseract library.
			Please install python modules pytesseract and PIL (pillow) to run this script.

			Usage: python tesseract-ocr.py INPUT-FILE

[5] post-process.py:	REST API created in Python flask to post-process the output of OCR.
			The API takes plain-text output of OCR and extracts key-value pairs as per the given
			regex file.

			Command "python post-process.py" will start the service at 127.0.0.1:3000

			Input parameters for API:

			[1] text: TEXT_FILE containing plain-text output of OCR

			[2] regex: REGEX_FILE to extract key-value pairs. 
			    This file should be placed in /regex directory.
